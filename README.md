# Collaborative Object Transportation. Multi-Agent System. Leader-Follower Coordination Strategy.

> In this system, one agent is designated as the leader, and the other agent is a follower. The leader is responsible for coordinating the movement of the follower to ensure that the object is transported safely and efficiently.

## Objective

Creating a multi-agent system where two agents represented as robots collaborate to transport an object from one location to another in a simulated environment.

## Task 

The task for the two robots is to work together to pick up an object at a specified location{ObjectPosition}, transport it while maintaining balance, and place it at the destination{DestinationPosition}. The environment is a 2D space.

## Built With

- Java
- Jade
- JavaFX
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
